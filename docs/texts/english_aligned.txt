Good morning, boss! 
Wow, you're looking energetic today! 
Really? 
I feel the same as always... 
Well, you're always pretty good, but you've been looking better and better lately. 
Our company's results are also looking good, and getting better every day. 
Well, we have everyone's hard work to thank for that. 
Boss, you're here early. These days a boss as dedicated as you is hard to come by! 
I've got to come early. 
Nowadays a lot of bosses push their work onto their employees. 
But you do it yourself, and teach us how to do it. 
We've learned a lot from you these past few years. 
That's my job. 
Only when you all make progress does the company make progress. 
Good morning boss! 
You look good in a suit. 
You've really stayed in shape. You must have some secret technique? 
How can you call a belly this big "staying in shape?" 
That's just showing your success. 
Some people who want that can't get it. 
What day is today? 
Everyone is complimenting me. 
Oh, that's right! 
Today I have to decide who gets promoted...
