#
# This directory demonstrates how to compile software against Adso
# using the compiled library you get by compiling the software 
# and installing it:
#
# make
# make install
#
# If you are interested in making 3rd party software, this is the 
# recommended way of doing it. Look at the main function inside the
# file "main.cpp" to see how things work. It is not that difficult, 
# but you may want to get in touch by email for specifics.
#
# Simply put, make sure to include the directory with the basic source
# code and the link to the adso library -ladso
#
# See the Makefile for questions
