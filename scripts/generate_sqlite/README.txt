The scripts in this directory compile the Adso database into an 
SQLITE database for use in the SQLITE Adso distribution. Just type:

./run

This will execute the numbered scripts in this directory one-by-one, 
and will take quite a bit of time. When it is done, you should have 
a wonderful new file "adso.db" sitting in this directory.
