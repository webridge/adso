 This directory contains everything you need to setup a Chinese/English/Pinyin fulltext 
 search engine using Adso+Lucene. The code can also act as a tutorial for how to get
 started with Lucene and Adso.

 First of all, edit the scripts that compile and run the software, and replace the 
 /path/to references with the actual paths to the JAVA/JAR executables on your 
 system. 

 Then you will need to process the documents you wish to search using Adso, and 
 feed the resulting file into our AdsoIndexer class. The file that will be indexed 
 needs to have one document per line, with the following tab-separated fields

 1. Full unsegmented Chinese text
 2. Segmented simplified UTF8 text (segmented_utf8s)
 3. Segmented traditional UTF8 text (segmented_utf8c)
 4. Segmented pinyin (segmented_pinyin)
 5. Segmented english (segmented_english)
 6. unique identifier (URL/Document ID)
 7. publication date?

 Index the document like this:

 ./run index [document] 

 Search it with:

 ./run search [searchterm] [searchfield]
