 We're going to index a file containing Chinese text. Assuming you 
 have Adso installed at the command line, do this:

   php 1_prepare_file_for_indexing.php [your_file] > index_me.txt

 You can open up the file index_me.txt and see what it looks like.
 Basically, we've just processed the file into a tab-separated document.
 We want the file index_me.txt to contain as many documents as we
 want to index. One document per line. We feed this document into 
 a special class we've created that indexes them according to the 
 following information 

    simplified chinese
    traditional chinese
    english 
    pinyin

 Brilliant... you now have four ways of searching the same Chinese
 text. And everything is searchable in real-time.

 NOTE: we need each document to have a unique ID in order to index
 it properly. We take the document name as the UID unless you edit 
 the PHP script or write your own. Feel free to hack around with the 
 actual Java class to customize it there.

 When you have a file ready to index and are ready to stick it into 
 your new search engine, head into the java/ subdirectory and read 
 the README file.
